# Quant_Prep

Target Role: Quantitative Trader / Researcher
Focus: Computational Linear Algebra, Statistical Modeling, Algorithmic Strategy Backtesting

This repository serves as the public proof-of-work for my self-directed pivot into quantitative finance. It documents my daily progress in mastering the mathematical and computational stack required for high-frequency trading and research.

Academic Foundation:

    Roosevelt University: B.S.B.A. Finance (Quantitative Track), 4.0 GPA.

    Stuyvesant High School: Alumnus (2019), 1480 SAT (780 Math).

    Transfer Credits: Validated coursework in Calculus I and Computer Science I.

Current Trajectory:

    Enrolled in MATH 246 (Linear Algebra) and FIN 311 (Principles of Finance) for Spring 2026.

    Executing a self-designed curriculum in Python, NumPy, and Econometrics.

Competitive Edge:

    Varsity Esports Athlete (League of Legends): 6-0 ECAC record. Expertise in real-time risk assessment, strategic execution under pressure, and team coordination.

    Founder, Digital Strategy: Built a media brand generating revenue through data-driven content optimization.

📚 Technical Curriculum & Progress

I am not only learning these topics, I am implementing them computationally. Every concept is (attempted) verified with code.

1. Mathematics (The Foundation)

    Linear Algebra (MATH 246): IN CLASS (Spring 2026)

    MIT 18.06 (Gilbert Strang): Self-learning - Vectors, Matrix operations, Eigenvalues, Decomposition.

    Calculus (I, II, III): Self-learning

REFRESHER

    3Blue1Brown, Paul's Online Math Notes, Multivariate differentiation, Optimization, Series.

    Probability & Stats

PLANNED (Post-Linear Algebra)

    Wasserman's All of Statistics

    Statistical inference, Probability distributions, Hypothesis testing.

2. Programming (The Tool)

    Kaggle, Self-Study

    Clean code practices, Data structures.

    Pandas / NumPy

    Data manipulation, Vectorized operations, Time Series indexing.


Projects & Proof of Work

    Commits are made to reflect active engagement with problem sets and project builds.

📂/Mathematics

Linear Algebra Verification: Jupyter Notebooks that computationally solve and verify problem sets from MIT 18.06.

Example: Using np.linalg.solve to verify manual Gaussian elimination.

📂/Backtesters (In Development)

SMA Crossover Backtester (Planned): A Python script leveraging Pandas to model and backtest a 50/200-day moving average trading strategy on historical equities data (SPY).

Goal: To demonstrate end-to-end backtesting capability, including data ingestion, signal generation, and performance metrics.

📂/Projects

NVDA - Factor Exposure Analysis
